// Simple example of a React "smart" component

import Workspace from '../components/Workspace';

// Don't forget to actually use connect!
// Note that we don't export Workspace, but the redux "connected" version of it.
// See https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#examples
export default Workspace;
